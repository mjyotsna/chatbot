Changing the way people engage with and obtain information about universities is the goal of the university information chatbot project. Providing prompt and accurate answers to questions about admissions, academic programs, campus facilities, activities, and more is its main goal, along with improving accessibility and user experience. Human resources can concentrate on more intricate work and individualized interactions as a result of the chatbot's ability to handle regular requests. In order to continuously enhance both its functionality and the user experience as a whole, the chatbot also solicits input in an effort to boost engagement by making tailored recommendations based on user preferences and interests. By means of its extensive features, the chatbot functions as an online advisor, guaranteeing that all users—faculty, staff, alumni, current students, and potential students—are knowledgeable.
